Working with Python Functions

  I. Python function to check to check whether a number is Prime or not
  
  II.Python function that when you inputs a number the function you have created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not.
  
NB: You have to push your work on any github/gitlab or bitbucket and share the link, all the best Happy coding.

## Description of Project

This project will help to detect Real and Fake news from the provided ‘news.csv’ file in the zip.file. This file has already labelled Fake and Real news. Our task is to create a model in which it takes the text data and outputs whether the news is Real or Fake. Distinguishing between the two.

We shall be using the following features and dependables:

1. Data Analysis
2. Python Libraries Imported
3. Data Pre-processing.
4. Vectorization.
5. Modeling.
6. Conclusion

NB: Creating a Fake News detection system explores different techniques which are explores the content and fact-checking. This implicates that models created from data science machine algorithms can verify and distinguish fake news from real news.
